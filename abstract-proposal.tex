The proposed research
is a study of processor architecture for
large scale parallel computer systems.
The thesis introduces mechanisms
for fast context switching,
synchronization between tasks,
and run-time binding of
variable names to processor memory.
Various design tradeoffs are evaluated
through simulation of a processor running a typical load.
This work contains
estimates of
the speed and complexity of the different
alternatives as implemented in  VLSI.
