The proposed research is a study of performance issues that come up in engineering large-scale proof-based systems in Coq.
The thesis presents lessons learned about achieving acceptable performance in Coq in the course of case-studies on formalizing category theory, developing a parser synthesizer, and constructing a verified compiler for synthesizing efficient low-level cryptographic primitives.
We also present a novel method of simple and fast reification, and a prototype tool for faster rewriting and customizable reduction which does not require extending Coq's trusted code base.
