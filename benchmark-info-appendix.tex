\chapter{Notes on the Benchmarking Setup}\label{ch:appendix:benchmarking-setup}

We performed most benchmarks in this dissertation on a 3.5 GHz Intel Haswell running Linux and Coq 8.12.2 with OCaml 4.06.1.
We describe in this appendix exceptions to this benchmarking setup.

Excepting the benchmarks in \Autoref{ch:rewriting,ch:reification-by-parametricity} and \autoref{ch:appendix:rewriting}, all of the benchmarks can be found in the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/JasonGross/doctoral-thesis} in the folder \texttt{performance-experiments} and the folder \texttt{performance-experiments-8-9}.
Most benchmarks in this dissertation, excepting those that depend on external plugins or very large codebases, have been ported to \url{https://github.com/coq-community/coq-performance-tests}, where we expect they will continue to be updated to work with the latest version of Coq.

\section{Plots in \autocommanameref{ch:intro}}\label{sec:benchmarking-setup:ch:intro}
We collected data for \autoref{fig:timing-montgomery-fesub-before-user:ch1} with Coq 8.8.2.
Due to various changes in notation printing, the code-printing pipeline for this old version of Fiat Cryptography does not work correctly with Coq versions $\ge$ 8.9.

\section{Plots in \autocommanameref{ch:perf-failures}}
\autoref{fig:timing-montgomery-fesub-before-user} is the same as \autoref{fig:timing-montgomery-fesub-before-user:ch1} which was discussed in \autoref{sec:benchmarking-setup:ch:intro}.
As in \autoref{fig:timing-montgomery-fesub-before-user} and for the same reasons, we collected data for \autoref{fig:timing-montgomery-fesub-after-user} with Coq 8.8.2.

We collected data for \Autoref{fig:timing-name-resolution,fig:timing-nested-lambda-different-name} with Coq 8.9.1 because Coq 8.10 and later do not show the relevant superlinear behavior due to \coqpr{9586}.

\section{Plots in \autocommanameref{ch:rewriting}}
All plots in \autoref{ch:rewriting} and its appendix (\autoref{ch:appendix:rewriting}) were constructed using measurements from Coq 8.10.0.
Gathering the data for these plots takes over a week, and we were loathe to repeatedly rerun the benchmarks using newer versions of Coq as they came out.
