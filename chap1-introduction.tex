  The most common mistake in performance engineering is to blindly optimize without profiling; you most often spend your time optimizing parts that aren't actually bottlenecks.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

High level story:

Coq and proof assistance are important. Performance in them is important, especially at scale. Performance engineering in proof assistants has some unique challenges that don't show up in other programming languages.

And I want to paint a picture of what the unique challenges are.  There are two main areas in the existing system that I want to call attention to, in regards to performance bottlenecks.  I will describe them, and describe the performance issues, and propose some reasons about why there might be performance bottlenecks, and describe solutions for them. And maybe also there'll be another section that has some miscellaneous other performance bottlenecks.

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Mention domains: math/CT and program transformation
%  \item Case studies: parsers, fiat-crypto, CT library
%\end{itemize}
