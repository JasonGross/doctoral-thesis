\chapter{Tooling fixes (improvements in Coq)} \label{ch:coq-tooling-fixes}

So those are the two main sections the thesis. And then there's another section of other small. Miscellaneous things that come up better like performance bottlenecks. Through like can or performance concerns, let's say these are things like decide design decisions that can have quadratic impacts. Um, Decisions about like what parts of cop to use for what and like why some bits might be more or less slow than others. 

Yeah, that's that's that section and then I think I'm going to have seconds last section. Be a sort of retrospective of like places where cocks performance has gotten better in the past like decade or so of like I started with a bunch of ways that solving performance issues improved systems is heard but here are some successes and things where like we've managed to improve things and you can actually like, Leverage this for faster performance.
