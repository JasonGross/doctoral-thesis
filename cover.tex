% NOTE:
% These templates make an effort to conform to the MIT Thesis specifications,

% Libraries before printing your final copy.

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.
\supervisor{Adam Chlipala}{Associate Professor of Computer Science}

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.

First, thank you, Adam Chlipala, for your patience, guidance, encouragement, advice, and wisdom, during the writing of this thesis, and through my research career.
I obviously don't know what it's like to have any other PhD advisor, but I can't imagine having a PhD advisor who would have been better for my mental health than you.
I want to thank my coworkers, with special thanks to you Andres for many engaging conversations and rich and productive collaborations.
Thank you, Mom, for taking every opportunity to enrich my life and setting me on this path.
% Thank you, Mom, for encouraging me from my youth and supporting me in all that I do.
Thank you Rachel, Dad, and the rest of my family, you've always been kind and supportive.
Thank you, Allison Strandberg, for your friendship through the years.
Thank you Rajee Agrawal for your faith in me and for everything you've done to help me excel.

I want to thank Andres Erbsen for pointing out to me some of the particular performance bottlenecks in Coq that I made use of in this thesis, including those of subsubsection \nameref{sec:sharing} in \autoref{sec:sharing} and those of subsections \nameref{sec:name-resolution}, \nameref{sec:perf:capture-avoiding-subst}, \nameref{sec:perf:quadratic-evar-subst}, and \nameref{sec:perf:quadratic-application} in \autoref{sec:perf:binder-count}.

I want to thank the Coq development team---without whom I would not have a proof assistant to use---for their patience and responsiveness to my many, many bug reports, feature requests, and questions.
Special thanks to Pierre-Marie Pédrot for doing the heavy lifting of tracking down performance issues inside Coq and explaining them to me, and fixing many of them.
I'd also like to thank Matthieu Sozeau for adding support for universe polymorphism and primitive projections to Coq, and responding to all of my bug reports on the functionality and performance of these features from my work on the HoTT Category Theory library during the development of these features.

I'd like to thank the rest of my thesis committee---Professor Saman Amarasinghe and Professor Nickolai Zeldovich---for their support and direction during the editing of this thesis and my defense.

\minortodo{thank various other people: friends, Allison Strandberg (incl. for chatting with me about thesis), maybe András Kovács on perf discussions}


\minortodo{rearrange}
\minortodo{make sure we didn't miss anything}
A significant fraction of the text of this thesis is taken from papers I've co-authored during my PhD, sometimes with major edits, other times with only minor edits to conform to the flow of the thesis.

In particular:
\minortodo{how to format citations here}

\Autoref{sec:category-theory-library,sec:duality-conversion,sec:associators,sec:equality-reflection,sec:abstraction-barriers} are taken from \citetitle{category-coq-experience}~\cite{category-coq-experience}.
Some of the text in \Autoref{sec:univ-poly,sec:HITs} comes from \citetitle{category-coq-experience}~\cite{category-coq-experience}

\Autoref{ch:rewriting} is largely taken from a draft paper co-authored with Andres Erbsen and Adam Chlipala.
\minortodo{actually cite rewriting}

\Autoref{sec:reification-by-parametricity:intro,sec:reif-survey} is based on the introduction to \textcite{reification-by-parametricity}.
\Autoref{ch:reification-by-parametricity} is largely taken from \textcite{reification-by-parametricity}, with some new text for this thesis.

\minortodo{do we need/want to mention this?  how to cite it?}
We would like to thank read and cite Karl Palmskog for pointing us at \textcite{Should1999Lamport} and \textcite{Formalising2018Paulson}.%

.
We would like to thank Pierre-Marie Pédrot for conversations on Coq's Gitter and his help in tracking down performance bottlenecks in earlier versions of our reification scripts and in Coq's tactics.
We would like to thank Beta Ziliani for his help in using Mtac2, as well as his invaluable guidance in figuring out how to use canonical structures to reify to PHOAS.
We also thank John Wiegley for feedback on \textcite{reification-by-parametricity}, which is included in slightly-modified form distributed between \autoref{ch:reification-by-parametricity} and various sections of \autoref{ch:reflection}.
% \todo{Figure out if anyone else needs mentioning}

For those interested in history, our method of reification by parametricity was inspired by the \texttt{evm\_compute} tactic~\cite{MirrorShardITP14}.
We first made use of \texttt{pattern} to allow \texttt{vm\_compute} to replace \texttt{cbv}-with-an-explicit-blacklist when we discovered \texttt{cbv} was too slow and the blacklist too hard to maintain.
We then noticed that in the sequence of doing abstraction; \texttt{vm\_compute}; application; $\beta$-reduction; reification, we could move $\beta$-reduction to the end of the sequence if we fused reification with application, and thus reification by parametricity was born.

Work on the category theory library, one of the case studies presented in \autoref{ch:api-design} and presented more fully in \textcite{category-coq-experience}, was supported in part by the MIT bigdata@CSAIL initiative, NSF grant CCF-1253229, ONR grant N000141310260, and AFOSR grant FA9550-14-1-0031.
