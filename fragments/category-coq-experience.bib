	a foundational system for mathematics based on a homotopical interpretation

	Such categories satisfy a version of the Univalence Axiom, saying
	that the type of isomorphisms between any two objects is equivalent
	to the identity type between these objects; we call them "saturated"
	or "univalent" categories. Moreover, we show that any category is
	weakly equivalent to a univalent one in a universal way. In homotopical
	and higher-categorical semantics, this construction corresponds to
	a truncated version of the Rezk completion for Segal spaces, and
	also to the stack completion of a prestack.},

  title = {Type checking with universes},
  journal = {Theoretical Computer Science },
  year = {1991},
  volume = {89},
  pages = {107 - 136},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Various formulations of constructive type theories have been proposed
	to serve as the basis for machine-assisted proof and as a theoretical
	basis for studying programming languages. Many of these calculi include
	a cumulative hierarchy of ``universes'', each a type of types closed
	under a collection of type-forming operations. Universes are of interest
	for a variety of reasons, some philosophical (predicative vs. impredicative
	type theories), some theoretical (limitations on the closure properties
	of type theories) and some practical (to achieve some of the advantages
	of a type of all types without sacrificing consistency.) The Generalized
	Calculus of Constructions (CC$^\omega$) is a formal theory of types
	that includes such a hierarchy of universes. Although essential to
	the formalization of constructive mathematics, universes are tedious
	to use in practice, for one is required to make specific choices
	of universe levels and to ensure that all choices are consistent.
	In this paper we study several problems associated with type checking
	in the presence of universes in the context of CC$^\omega$. First,
	we consider the basic type checking and well-typedness problems for
	this calculus. Second, we consider a formulation of Russell and Whitehead's
	``typical ambiguity'' convention whereby universe levels may be elided,
	provided that some consistent assignment of levels leads to a correct
	derivation. Third, we consider the introduction of definitions to
	both the basic calculus and the calculus with typical ambiguity.
	This extension leads to a notion of ``universe polymorphism'' analogous
	to the type polymorphism of ML. Although our study is conducted for
	CC$^\omega$, we expect that our methods will apply to other variants
	of the Calculus of Constructions and to type theories such as Constable's
	V3.},
