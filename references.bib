  abstract        = {We present a new strategy for performing reification in Coq.
That is, we show how to generate first-class abstract syntax trees from ``native'' terms of Coq's logic, suitable as inputs to verified compilers or procedures in the \emph{proof-by-reflection} style.
Our new strategy, based on simple generalization of subterms as variables, is straightforward, short, and fast.
In its pure form, it is only complete for constants and function applications, but ``let'' binders, eliminators, lambdas, and quantifiers can be accommodated through lightweight coding conventions or preprocessing.

We survey the existing methods of reification across multiple Coq metaprogramming facilities, describing various design choices and tricks that can be used to speed them up, as well as various limitations.
We report benchmarking results for 18 variants, in addition to our own, finding that our own reification outperforms 16 of these methods in all cases, and one additional method in some cases; writing an OCaml plugin is the only method tested to be faster.
Our method is the most concise of the strategies we considered, reifying terms using only two to four lines of \texttt{Ltac}---beyond lists of the identifiers to reify and their reified variants.
Additionally, our strategy automatically provides error messages that are no less helpful than Coq's own error messages.},

	Such categories satisfy a version of the Univalence Axiom, saying
	that the type of isomorphisms between any two objects is equivalent
	to the identity type between these objects; we call them "saturated"
	or "univalent" categories. Moreover, we show that any category is
	weakly equivalent to a univalent one in a universal way. In homotopical

	a truncated version of the Rezk completion for Segal spaces, and

  abstract     = {Various formulations of constructive type theories have been proposed
	to serve as the basis for machine-assisted proof and as a theoretical
	basis for studying programming languages. Many of these calculi include
	a cumulative hierarchy of ``universes'', each a type of types closed
	under a collection of type-forming operations. Universes are of interest
	for a variety of reasons, some philosophical (predicative vs. impredicative
	type theories), some theoretical (limitations on the closure properties
	of type theories) and some practical (to achieve some of the advantages
	of a type of all types without sacrificing consistency.) The Generalized
	Calculus of Constructions (CC$^\omega$) is a formal theory of types
	that includes such a hierarchy of universes. Although essential to
	the formalization of constructive mathematics, universes are tedious
	to use in practice, for one is required to make specific choices
	of universe levels and to ensure that all choices are consistent.
	In this paper we study several problems associated with type checking
	in the presence of universes in the context of CC$^\omega$. First,
	we consider the basic type checking and well-typedness problems for
	this calculus. Second, we consider a formulation of Russell and Whitehead's
	``typical ambiguity'' convention whereby universe levels may be elided,
	provided that some consistent assignment of levels leads to a correct
	derivation. Third, we consider the introduction of definitions to
	both the basic calculus and the calculus with typical ambiguity.
	This extension leads to a notion of ``universe polymorphism'' analogous
	to the type polymorphism of ML. Although our study is conducted for
	CC$^\omega$, we expect that our methods will apply to other variants
	of the Calculus of Constructions and to type theories such as Constable's
	V3.},
